[SAP Business ByDesign Side-by-Side Extensions on SAP Cloud Platform](https://blogs.sap.com/2019/02/03/sap-business-bydesign-side-by-side-extensions/?preview_id=774314).

## Description 
The repository contains a step-by-step tutorial that assists you to build your first SAP Business ByDesign side-by-side extension application on SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment using SAP Cloud Application Programming Model.
## Scenario
Our goal is to develop a simple sales order processing application. The sales order processing application shall enable the end-user to create, read, update and delete sales order instances out of Fiori UIs. More over the end-user will have the possibility to execute product availability check out of the UI. The execution of product availability check will lead to the population of the confirmed quantity with a random value between 0 and the requested quantity. 
The sales order processing application will enable the end-user to create sales order instances for products that are read from SAP Business ByDesign tenant using OData APIs.

## Requirements 

 - SAP SMB Summit 2019 will provide you with SAP Business ByDesign tenant required for developing the extension application 'Sales Order Processing' .
 - The extension application will be deployed in SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry environment. Therefore, you will need SAP Cloud Platform Cloud Foundry subaccount. Additionally, a NEO subaccount is required to run SAP Web IDE. A trial SAP Cloud Platform account with Cloud Foundry and NEO subaccounts is sufficient for the implementation of this extension. If you don't have SAP Cloud Platform trial account, the first step of the exercise will guide you on how to acquire SAP Cloud Platform trial account.
 - We will use SAP Cloud Platform Web IDE Full-Stack as development
   environment.  Detailed Information on how to setup the development
   environment will be given in the first step of the exercise.
## Exercises
The SAP Business ByDesign side-by-side extension on SAP Cloud Platform tutorial consists of two exercises. The first exercise is the main exercise and will cover the development of persistence layer, service layer and UI layer. The second exercise is a bonus exercise, that you can try out if you have time left after completing the first exercise. Alternatively, you can also clone the master branch of this repository and carry out exercise 2.
###  Exercise 1
#### Step 1: System Set up
Follow the instructions in the following blog post to set up a development and deployment environment for the SAP usiness ByDesign side-by-side extension application.

### Exercise 2
In this exercise we will enhance the Sales Order Processing Application in such a way that business partner data from SAP Business ByDesign can be used as customer during sales order entry. That is. the value help of the customer related field will trigger the reading of business partner (customer) data from SAP Business ByDesign tenant using OData API.
#### Prerequisite 
Exercise 1 is a prerequisite for exercise 2. Therefore, to start with exercise 2 you have to complete exercise 1 or clone the final state of exercise 1 from the [master branch](https://github.wdf.sap.corp/D034669/SAP-Business-ByDesign-Side-by-Side-Extensions-on-SAP-Cloud-Platform) of this repository. 
#### Step 1:  Enhance the data model
1.  Go to the file WorkSpace/SalesOrderProcessing/db/data-model.cds and double click the file.
2. Adjust the content of the file data.model.cds  as shown in the screen shot below. That is, for the entity Salesorder replace the element customer with customerID and add a new element customerName.

#### Step 2: Add Remote Service
In this step we will add a customer data remote service (SAP usiness ByDesign Customer OData API) to the Sales Order Processing application.

 1. Right click on WorkSpace/SalesOrderProcessing/srv and select New → Data Model from External Service.

 2. On the ‘Data Connection’ screen select under ‘Sources’ the entry ‘Service URL’ and click on ‘create new data sources’

![](./Resource/images/Remote_Service_03.jpg)

 -  On the following screen populate the fields as specified below and click Create.
![](./Resource/images/Destination_for_external_datamodel.jpg)
 -  Next, enter the relative URL of the OData API and press Test. ‘/sap/byd/odata/cust/v1/byd_customer/$metadata’ is an example of relative URL of the OData API. If the result looks like in the screen shot below click Next.
![](./Resource/images/Data_model_from_external_service_1.jpg)
 -  On the ‘Confirmation’ screen select ‘Generate Virtual Data Model Classes’ and click Finish. This will lead, among others, to the generation of service definitions (e.g. byd_customer.json and byd_customer.xml) in the folder WorkSpace/SalesOrderProcessing/srv/external/csn.
